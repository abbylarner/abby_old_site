Quintessence Biosciences:

About:
Quintessence Biosciences is a biotech company based out of Madison, Wisconsin.  This project involved a redesign of their marketing site.  They have a lot of content and needed to restructure it so that it was more readible and navigable. They also wanted to showcase their equipment and process for investors and non-technical individuals.

Research:
For this project, I studied different labs and biotech companies and how they presented information.  I used some of the strategies and techniques that I found worked well to present information to a non-technical audience (such as breaking up information into more digestible chunks and displaying information visually) to help inform the design.

Challenges:
The most challenging aspect of this project was organizing and presenting the content.  It was also a challenge to make sure the website was consistent with an existing brand.

Design:
I decided on a minimal color scheme, mostly using dark grey and pink, so that the main focus of the website was the content.  I put the most relevant information for non-technical people on the homepage and the more technical information on other internal pages.  This allows non-technical viewers to find the information they need quickly and more technical viewers would be able to navigate easily to find more detailed information.
