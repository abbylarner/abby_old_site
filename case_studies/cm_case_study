Crossfit Madtown:

About:
CrossFit Madtown is a CrossFit gym in Madison, Wisconsin. However, while CrossFit Madtown offers CrossFit, they also offer many other Athletic Development programs including: Youth Development programs,  High School and Sport Specific Athletic Performance training, and Olympic Weight Lifting.

Challenges:
CrossFit Madtown attracts and grooms elite atheletes, but they didn't want to be know as a "hard core" gym because they are also very friendly to beginners and children.

Research:
I performed competitive market and SWOT analyses of the Madison-Area CrossFit gyms.  I found that many gyms were designed and portrayed as "intense" or "hard core" often using dark colors and images of very fit individuals.  

Design:
Because I wanted to avoid this stereotype, I decided to design with lighter colors, and treat the images to make them look a little more vintage/friendly.  I also did the photography for the site and made sure include pictures of their wide demographic of athletes.
